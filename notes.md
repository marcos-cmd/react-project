# React Notes

## Meet the React Ecosystem
- Separation of concerns is the theme

    ### React Redux
    - Its purpose is to manage the state of our React App
    - It does this using the Flux Architecture

    ### Thunk
    - side-effect management (network, requests, etc.)

    ### Reselect
    - abstracts the details of how our details are stored in the state

    ### Styled Components
    - abstract away the state's structure

## What do we need for React? 
1. index.html
2. Support for ES6
3. webpack (takes care of building our app, allows for CSS modules, and serve the app)
4. Root Component (container that will hold the rest of our components)
5. react-hot-loader (allows us to see our changes without refreshing our app each time)
